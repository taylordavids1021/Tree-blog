        "description": "A place to draw from an essential part of growth
                        My beginnings that shaped and nurtured the future me
                        When my world feels shaky as if my roots are being torn away
                        And loved ones begin to depart
                        I have only to reflect on these golden memories that we call yesterday
                        The smoothness of a babys skin
                        A wrinkled smile that lights up the room
                        Words of wisdom suggested with love
                        Sad occasions where prayers are mingled with tears
                        Happy holidays where love and laughter and good food abound
                        Hands joined in prayer connecting with one another and with God
                        And then I know that my roots are secure
                        For as a root draws water from the soil I too can draw strength from that innermost part of my private self
                        Knowing that my roots are not gone But are tenderly and lovingly multiplying 
                        Sending out new growth in the never-ending scheme of life Which has perfect order",
